I've known Rory Aronson for quite a while - originally through [SLO Op Climbing][0] (our local community bouldering gym), and later through his involvement with the Board of Directors of the [SLO MakerSpace][1]. Rory has a way of getting himself involved in community-based, sometimes somewhat counter-cultural projects. His current project is [FarmBot][2], an open source, web controlled farming machine designed to optimize small-scale urban farming and empower more people to start growing their own food. Using technology to manage farming isn't a new idea, but so far it's been limited mostly to large-scale, industrial agriculture. The rest of us work mostly with hand trowels and kneepads, learning when to sow our seeds, water our sprouts, and harvest our food from books, blogs, and homemade YouTube videos. Rory's goal with FarmBot is to bring the same kinds of precision tools used by big business to small scale home gardeners.

To learn more about FarmBot, which will be having a Kickstarter to raise funds in the near future, check out [Rory's FarmBot website][2], as well as the [FarmBot Wiki][3] that Rory developed to organize documentation, schematics, assembly guides, troubleshooting tips, and all kinds of other info for the FarmBot project.

Both of these images were made on medium format film (Portra 160) using my Hasselblad V-series camera. The film was processed by the wonderful Richard Photo Lab in Valencia, CA.
